          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
          amazing experience here. I signed up for free intro course and found
          it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
          was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
          Engineer at a VR startup"

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommeded!

        <p class="testimonial-text">
          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of a code. I
          needed some structure from the professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of their who can only say wonderful thing about the
          program.The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
          team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to a
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommeded!"
